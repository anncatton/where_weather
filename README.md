Where in the world is my weather?

This is a location-based web app that finds places around the world with matching weather
conditions. Uses the aerisweather api, and haversine gem to calculate distance between
locations. Set it to compare to your local weather, or just type in a city to see what 
matches where!

Matches are based on current conditions, temperature, dewpoint and, to a lesser extent, 
humidity and windspeed. Currently this is a work in progress. Planning to build this out
as a mobile app.
